## The 7-minute workout is a form of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) that offers a quick and efficient way to get a full-body workout. It was developed by Brett Klika and Chris Jordan, and it gained popularity due to its simplicity and time-saving nature.

# The workout consists of 12 exercises, each performed for 30 seconds with a 10-second rest period in between. These exercises target different muscle groups and provide a cardiovascular challenge. Here's a breakdown of the exercises typically included in the 7-minute workout:

1 Jumping Jacks: Begin with your feet together and hands by your sides. Jump while spreading your legs wider than hip-width and raising your arms overhead. Jump again to return to the starting position.

2 Wall Sit: Stand with your back against a wall and slide down until your knees are bent at a 90-degree angle. Hold this position, as if sitting in an imaginary chair, for the duration of the exercise.

3 Push-Ups: Start in a plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Lower your body to the ground by bending your elbows, then push yourself back up to the starting position.

4 Abdominal Crunches: Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Place your hands behind your head and lift your shoulders off the ground using your abdominal muscles. Lower back down without fully resting your shoulders on the ground.

5 Step-Ups onto a Chair: Find a sturdy chair or step. Step up onto the chair with one foot, then bring the other foot up as well. Step back down and alternate leading foot with each repetition.

6 Squats: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and toes pointing slightly outward. Lower your body by bending your knees and pushing your hips back, as if sitting down. Return to the starting position by pushing through your heels.

7 Tricep Dips on a Chair: Sit on a chair and place your hands on the edge of the seat, fingers pointing forward. Slide your hips forward and lower your body by bending your elbows. Push yourself back up to the starting position.

8 Plank: Start in a push-up position, then lower your forearms to the ground, with your elbows directly below your shoulders. Keep your body straight and hold this position, engaging your core muscles.

9 High Knees: Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Alternate lifting your knees as high as possible while jogging in place. Keep a quick pace throughout the exercise.

10 Lunges: Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Step forward with one leg and lower your body until both knees are bent at a 90-degree angle. Push off with your front foot and return to the starting position. Alternate legs with each repetition.

11 Push-Up with Rotation: Perform a regular push-up, but as you push yourself back up, rotate your body to one side, extending your arm upwards. Return to the starting position and repeat, alternating sides with each repetition.

12 Side Plank: Lie on your side with your forearm on the ground, elbow beneath your shoulder. Lift your hips off the ground, creating a straight line from your head to your feet. Hold this position, engaging your oblique muscles. Repeat on the other side.

The idea behind the 7-minute workout is to perform each exercise with maximum effort within the given time frame. It offers a quick and intense workout that can be done almost anywhere, making it a convenient option for individuals with busy schedules or limited time for exercise.
